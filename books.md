This section covers various kinds of books that I think are worth reading.

_Note that I've read each one as an Audiobook, either from Audible or using other means. If you're interested in listening to any of them but are unable to (can't find/purchase it due to Audible being picky about the country you're from), let me know and I'll gladly help._

### Fantasy

{:.book}
- **The Stormlight Archive** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive)] by Brandon Sanderson -- by far the most interesting fantasy world I have explored. The books are relatively long (save Edgedancer, which is a novella set between the 1st and the 2nd book), but very much worth the read (or listen).
	1. **The Way of Kings**
	2. **Words of Radiance**
	3. **Oathbringer**
	4. **The Rhythm of War**

- **Mistborn** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn_series)] by Brandon Sanderson -- another amazing series from Brandon Sanderson. It has a well thought-out magic system, despite being set in the same universe as The Stormlight Archive ([Cosmere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Cosmere)). The first and the second series vary greatly in their setting (medieval \(\times\) industrial revolution), but I would argue that both are a great fit.
	1. **The Final Empire**
	2. **The Well of Ascension**
	3. **The Hero of Ages**
	4. **The Alloy of Law**
	5. **Shadows of Self**
	6. **The Bands of Mourning**
	7. **The Lost Metal** (to be released)

- **Skyward** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyward_(novel))] by Brandon Sanderson -- as a huge fan of Sanderson's fictional work, I was not sure about him pulling off a good space opera, but I was wrong. The series is a breath of fresh air in the midst of all of his fantasy worlds (at least to someone who's been binging all of Sanderson's work).
	1. **Skyward**
	2. **Starsight**
	3. **Nowhere**

- **The Rithmatist** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rithmatist)] by Brandon Sanderson -- an excellent young adult fantasy novel. Although the target audience is children (which is reflected mostly in character behavior and development), I still loved discovering the unique magic system that Sanderson created.

- **Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(novella_series))] by Brandon Sanderson -- a set of three novellas about a man, whose hallucinations (the so-called aspects) help him with logic, problem solving, languages and much more. It's a great premise with quite an exciting ending, but I'm definitely more into his fantasy works.

- **The Reckoners** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoners)] by Brandon Sanderson -- a set of three novels set in a post-apocalyptic world where random people are transformed into superhumans with various kinds of abilities. The atmosphere is great, but the writing is targeted at a younger audience, which is noticable.
	1. **Steelheart**
	2. **Firefight**
	3. **Calamity**

- **Metro 2033** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033)] by Dimitry Glukhovsky -- a post-apocalyptic novel about people surviving a nuclear world war inside the Moscow metro. I really appreciated that there was a healthy mix of both action-packed passages and slower, more philosophical ones. Definitely worth the read, but the other books in the series are, in my opinion, not as good.

### Comedy

{:.book}
- **Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)] by Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman -- an absolute must-read auto(sort-of)biography about the life of Richard Feynman. I honestly don't understand how this many interesting things can happen in the life of a single person.

- **The Martian** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel))] by Andy Weir -- a hilarious novel about an astronaut surviving on Mars, after being left for dead due to an unfortunate series of events. It inspired a [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)#Reception), which (while not as good as the book) is also quite entertaining.

- **Project Hail Mary** [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary)] by Andy Weir -- another excellent novel by Andy Weir. It has exactly the same feel as the Martian, but I found it to be much more interesting story-wise and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in space sci-fi.

### Maths and Computer Science

{:.book}
- [CZ] **Průvodce labyrintem algoritmů** [[PDF](http://pruvodce.ucw.cz/static/pruvodce.pdf)] od Martina Mareše -- úžasná příručka (a skripta) pro studium algoritmů a datových struktur. Vřele doporučeno komukoliv, koho alespoň trochu zajímá teoretická informatika.

- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** [[PDF 2. ed.](http://guanzhou.pub/files/Computer%20System_EN.pdf)] -- an in-depth look at how computers actually work. A very comprehensive resource for CS-related courses, namely for those related to computer architecture.
