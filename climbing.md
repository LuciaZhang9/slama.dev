## [Sm√≠choff](https://www.lezeckecentrum.cz/cs/), Prague
Sm√≠choff is the only gym in Prague that I frequent, since it is (in my opinion) the best one, so the vast majority of the clips are going to be from here.
People are nice, prices are student-friendly and boulders are frequently changed, so it's a perfect place to be.

The following is a map of the entire bouldering section, separated into sections, with one being rebuilt every two weeks. 
Each section can be clicked on to see the videos of its boulder sends.

### Diary
The following contains my climbing diary -- how many new/old boulders have I done (and links to them). It also serves as a convenient way to view the most recently sent boulders.

Since there there are some other walls that I visit from time to time (mostly thanks to some of my friends), here is the list of icons that you might see in the journal entries:

| Icon                                                                                | Wall                                               | Location       |
