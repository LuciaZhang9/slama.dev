## [Smíchoff](https://www.lezeckecentrum.cz/cs/), Prague
Smíchoff is the only gym in Prague that I frequent, since it is (in my opinion) the best one, so the vast majority of the clips are going to be from here. People are nice, prices are student-friendly and boulders are frequently changed, so it's a perfect place to be.

The following is a map of the entire bouldering section, separated into sections, with one being rebuilt every two weeks.

### Diary
The following contains my climbing diary -- how many new/old boulders have I done (and links to them). It also serves as a convenient way to view the most recently sent boulders.

Since there there are some other locations that I visit from time to time (mostly thanks to some of my friends), here is the list of icons that you might see in the journal entries:

| Icon                                                                                        | Location                                           |
| :-:                                                                                         | :-:                                                |

The format for each difficulty is <mark class="climbing-diary-record climbing-other climbing-other-text">repeats/<span class="underline">new sends</span> [<a>video</a> <a>links</a>]</mark>, left-to-right from easy to hard. Additionally, climbs marked with the ↯ symbol mean that they were flashed.

_**Update** (4.7.2022): I've been feeling quite burnt-out and unsatisfied with my level of climbing for a while now and have mostly been recording videos out of inertia. I'm going to stop doing so for a while and just focus on climbing well, until I feel better and have the motivation to continue._
