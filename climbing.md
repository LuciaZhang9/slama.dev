This page is dedicated to my climbing life.

## [Smíchoff](https://www.lezeckecentrum.cz/cs/), Prague
Smíchoff is the only gym in Prague that I frequent, since it is (in my opinion) the best one, so the vast majority of the clips are going to be from here. People are nice, prices are student-friendly and boulders are frequently changed, so it's a perfect place to be.

The difficulty of boulders are as follows (left being the easiest, right being the hardest):

### Videos
The videos are split into various sections, mostly for practical reasons (easier to find a send when you know where it is located). To see the videos from the given section, simply click on it. Additionally, colors denote the type of overhang for the section of the gym: <mark class="climbing climbing-low-angle">low-angle</mark>, <mark class="climbing climbing-vertical">vertical</mark>, <mark class="climbing climbing-mild-overhang">mild overhang</mark>, <mark class="climbing climbing-severe-overhang">severe overhang</mark> and <mark class="climbing climbing-roof">roof</mark>.

Alternatively, there is also a page containing [all of the climbs](/climbing/zones/all).

### Diary
The following contains my climbing diary -- how many new/old boulders have I done (and links to them). It also serves as a convenient way to view the most recently sent boulders.

Since there there are some other locations that I visit from time to time (mostly thanks to some of my friends), here is the list of icons that you might see in the journal entries:

| Icon                                                                                        | Location                                           |
