I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ).
Their source code is open and can be [found here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

This page contains a list of all the videos (by category), along with links to their YouTube, source code, subtitles and downloads in various resolutions.
