I occasionally create videos about math/computer science that I put up on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IaBSHmisYbiYlv32EeNkQ) and [Odysee](https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TomasSlama) channels, written in Python with Manim. Their source code is open and can be [found here](https://github.com/xiaoxiae/videos).

This page contains a list of all the videos (by category), along with links to their YouTube, source code, subtitles and downloads in various resolutions (h264-encoded).
