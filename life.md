I've long since wanted to share exciting things that happened in my life, interesting thoughts that I had on my way to a lecture or, more generally, anything that didn't warrant an entire post of its own.
This is my place to do just that.

It might disappear in a week if I decide this idea is stupid, or might stay up for the next 25 years, only time will tell 🤷‍♂️. In the meantime, welcome 🙂.
