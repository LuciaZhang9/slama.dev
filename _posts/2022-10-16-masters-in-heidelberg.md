I, along with my <a class='secret' href='/assets/kacka.webp'>lovely girlfriend</a>, recently moved to Heidelberg to pursue our respective master's degrees (Computer Science and Cancer Biology).
While Heidelberg is a beautiful city with great sights, interesting people and a [pretty good bouldering gym](https://www.boulderhaus.net/), the process of becoming a European international student can be quite challenging.

If you find yourself in a similar position (or are considering placing yourself in it), I hope this post will be useful to you, since it covers a number of the things I struggled with during the enrolment process and beyond.

_Note: this post is ever-expanding. If you've also experienced some issues with education in Heidelberg (or Germany, for that matter), please let me know and I'll add it here._

### Enrolment

#### Application

This step of the enrolment process is quite straightforward -- given your degree of interest (say [Computer Science](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/all-subjects/applied-computer-science/data-and-computer-science-master)), you need to find the required documents to send by post to the admission's office.
For me, this included
- a filled-in **application**,
- a certificate of **English profficiency** (at least B2)[^german]
- a transcript of **completed study requirements** (I haven't received my degree at a time),
- a certified copy of a **high-school diploma** and
- a copy of my **ID** (or a VISA, if you're not a European citizen).

[^german]: If it's a German master's degree, you'll need a certificate of German profficiency instead.

Once the admissions are opened (for us this was May/June 2022), the specific list will be at the respective degree's website.
You might have to do a little bit of digging and translating, though (the study requirements might be in German even if the degree isn't).

Sending the documents by post is best done by private carriers such as [UPS](https://www.ups.com/us/en/global.page) instead of the post, because they're faster, more liable and will notify you when the documents arrived, in exchange for being a little more costly (~€30 from the Czech Republic).

#### Immatriculation

Once you have been accepted and have received your letter of admission, you will know what other documents the university requires to finish your enrolment.
This can vary quite drastically between the degrees, what was required of me was
- a filled-in **application for immatriculation**[^address],
- a **university diploma** or a **final transcript** of my home university,
- a **passport-size photo** (35mm \(\times\) 45mm),
- **proof of health insurance**[^insurance],
- **proof of finance** (which is just [this document](/assets/masters-in-heidelberg/proof-of-finance.pdf)) and
- a copy of my **ID** (again, or a VISA for non-EU citizens).

[^address]: If you don't have a German address, just write something like _Documents will be picked up in person_ in the "Temporary residence in Germany" section and pick them up when you arrive in Heidelberg, else they will send them by post and it could take a **very** long time (much longer than the start of classes).

[^insurance]: This was a bit tricky. If you're outside of the EU, you'll need to contact an insurance provider in Germany. If you're from the EU, you most likely have a EHIC-compliant insurance card. **It is not enough to send a copy** as the university requires that a German insurance provider confirms the validity of the card. This was, however, relatively easy, as described in [this document](/assets/masters-in-heidelberg/insurance.pdf).

After everything has been sent, you'll need to wait a bit (say a week) and then pick up your documents (ID, Matriculation documents, etc.) from [this building](https://goo.gl/maps/LtnHGVDei4EtHR719).
At this point, there are some more steps, such as
- activating your student ID,
- checking your [email](https://sogo02.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/SOGo/),
- setting up Eduroam[^eduroam] and,
- paying the student fee[^fee],

[^eduroam]: The simplest way is using the [Configuration Assistant Tool](https://cat.eduroam.org).

but they are well-described in the documents you receive so I won't cover them here.
You should definitely check out the overview of the [most important services](https://urz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/newhere), which has a nice overview of services you're entitled to as a student.

[^fee]: This again depends on if you're an EU citizen (in which case the fee is quite large) or you are an EU citizen (the fee is pretty small, I payed ~€170). In any case, the payment can take a little while to confirm (at least when paying from Revolut), so don't panic.

### Money
If Euros aren't your nation's currency (which was the case for me as we use Czech Korunas), there is a chance that paying using your bank's card will include additional fees or unfavorable conversion rates.
If that is the case, it might be advisable to either
- set-up an account at a German bank or
- use services such as [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/) that facilitate currency conversions without additional fees.

I've chosen the Revolut path and it has been working well so far -- the app is easy to use, the money easy to track and the card has been working fine without any issues.
If you'd like to try it too, **let someone who already has Revolut know[^noone]** since they could invite you through Revolut's referal programme and receive some money for free.

[^noone]: If you don't know anyone and would like to help me out, let me know.


Most places in Heidelberg accept cards so you don't need to have a lot of cash on-hand.

### Housing
TODO: write about how fucked it is

### Travel
This depends a lot on where you live but it might be a good idea to purchase the [Semester Ticket](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/management-of-studies/tuition-fees/semester-ticket-for-public-transportation), which allows you to use pretty much[^noice] any public transport in the [Rhein-Neckar region](/assets/masters-in-heidelberg/rhein-neckar-region.webp), which includes Heidelberg, Mannheim and the surrounding towns.

[^noice]: This excludes high-speed trains (like ICE).

Also, if you get the chance to, **get a bike**.
Heidelberg is made for travel by bike -- it has great infrastructure (bike lanes and racks everywhere), cars are used to them and it is arguably the fastest way to travel here since the public transport always has delays.

Even if you don't live in Heidelberg, it might still be a good idea to get it since you can leave it at the train/tram station when traveling to/from Heidelberg, which saves quite a lot of time in the long run and is healthy!
