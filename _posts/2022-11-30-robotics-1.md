### Robotics Components
{% math ENdefinition "link/member" %}individual bodies making up a mechanism{% endmath %}

{% math ENdefinition "joint" %}connection between multiple links{% endmath %}

{% math ENdefinition "kinematic pair" %}two links in contact such that it limits their relative{% endmath %}

- **low-order** kinematic pairs: point of contact is a surface (eg. revolute/prismatic/spherical)
- **high-order** kinematic pairs: point of contact is a dot/line (eg. gears)

{% math ENdefinition "kinematic chain" %}assembly of links connected by joints{% endmath %}
- is a **closed loop** (left image) if every link is connected to every other by at least two paths (including the ground -- imagine it as a single link), else it's **open** (right image)

#### Degrees of Freedom

{% math ENdefinition: "deegree of freedom" %}of a mechanical system is the **number of independent parameters** that define its configuration. It can be calculated by the **Gr√ºbler Formula**:
{% endmath %}

\[\text{DOF} = \lambda (n - 1) - \sum_{i = 1}^{j} c_i\]

where 
- \(\lambda \ldots\)  DOF of the operating space (3 for 2D, 6 for 3D)
	- in 2D it's 2 for orientation and 1 for position
	- in 3D it's 3 for orientation and 3 for position
- \(n \ldots\) number of links
- \(j \ldots\) number of kinematic pairs
- \(c_j \ldots\) degree of constraint of the \(i\)-th kinematic pair
	- eg. a revolute joint in 2D takes away 2 DOF (we can only rotate)

For example, the following has \(3 (4 - 1) - 2 \cdot 4 = 1\) DOF:
![DOF](/assets/robotics-1/dof.svg)


{% math ENdefinition "coincident joints" %}when there are more than two kinematic pairs in the same joint{% endmath %}

![Coincident joints.](/assets/robotics-1/coincident-joints.svg)

#### Actuators
{% math ENdefinition "actuator" %}a mechanical device for moving or controlling something{% endmath %}

- **DC brushed motor**: based on Lorentz' force law (electromagnetic fields)
	- **brushed** because the metal brush powers the magnets (they're turning)
	- **brushless** uses the position of the motor to turn on/off currents for specific windings
	- usually contains **gears reductions** to trade torque for speed and **sensors** to measure the position of the motor (see further)

![DC motor illustration.](/assets/robotics-1/dc-motor.svg)

- since the voltage controls the motor but setting it to a specific value is impractical, **pulse width modulation (PWM)** is used:

![PWM](/assets/robotics-1/pwm.svg)

- to measure the position of the motor, **optical shaft encoders** (incremental/absolute) are used:

![Incremental and absolute optical encoders.](/assets/robotics-1/optical-encoders.svg)

### Kinematics
- establishment of various coordinate systems to represent the positions and orientations of rigid objects and with transformations among these coordinate systems

![Kinematic spaces.](/assets/robotics-1/kinematic-spaces.svg)

- the dimension of the **configuration space** (\(n\)) must be **larger or equal** to the dimension of the **task space** (\(m\)) to ensure the existence of kinematic solutions

#### Forward (direct) Kinematics

{% math ENdefinition "forward/direct kinematics" %}the process of finding the position/orientation of the **end-effector** \((r_1, \ldots, r_m)\) given a set of joint parameters \((q_1, \ldots, q_n)\).{% endmath %}

\[(r_1, \ldots, r_m) = F(q_1, \ldots, q_n)\]

##### Body Pose

The **pose/frame** of a rigid body can be described by its **position** and **orientation** (wrt. a reference frame).
- the **position** is a vector \(P \in \mathbb{R}^3\)
- the **rotation** is an **orthonormal matrix** \(R \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}\) with \(\det(R) = 1\) (a determinant of \(-1\) would flip the object, we only want rotation)
	- due to orthogonality: \(R^T = R^{-1}\)

\[R = \begin{bmatrix} x' & y' & z' \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_x' & y_x' & z_x' \\ x_y' & y_y' & z_y' \\ x_z' & y_z' & z_z' \end{bmatrix}\]

The elementary rotations about each of the axes are the following:

-->

\[
\begin{aligned}
	R_x(\alpha) &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha \\ 0 & \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha    \end{bmatrix} \\
	R_y(\alpha) &= \begin{bmatrix}  \cos \alpha & 0 & \sin \alpha  \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin \alpha & 0 & \cos \alpha  \end{bmatrix} \\
	R_z(\alpha) &= \begin{bmatrix}  \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha & 0 \\ \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

- important to remember for calculating robot kinematics (or just think about what the rotation about an axis is doing to the other two axes, it's not too hard to remember)
- positive values for the rotation are always **counter-clockwise**

When discussing multiple frames, we use the following notation:

\[{\scriptstyle \text{to} \atop \scriptstyle\text{from}} R = {\scriptstyle \text{to} \atop \scriptstyle\text{}} R {\scriptstyle \text{} \atop \scriptstyle\text{from}} = R {\scriptstyle \text{to} \atop \scriptstyle\text{from}} \]

E.g. if we have the same vector \(p\) as \(p_0, p_1, p_2\) in three different frames, we know that

\[
\begin{aligned}
p_1 &= R^1_2 \cdot p_2 \\
p_0 &= R^0_1 \cdot p_1 \\
p_0 &= R^0_2 \cdot p_2
\end{aligned}
\]

For a minimal representation, we will use **Euler's ZYZ angles**, which does three rotations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
	R &= R_z (\varphi) R_{y'} (\vartheta) R_{z''} (\psi) \\
	&= \begin{bmatrix} c_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} c_{\psi} - s_{\varphi} s_{\psi} & -c_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} s_{\psi} - s_{\varphi} c_{\psi} & c_{\varphi} s_{\vartheta} \\ s_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} c_{\psi} + c_{\varphi} s_{\psi} & -s_{\varphi} c_{\vartheta} s_{\psi} + c_{\varphi} c_{\psi} & s_{\varphi} s_{\vartheta} \\ -s_{\vartheta} c_{\psi} & s_{\vartheta} s_{\psi} & c_{\vartheta} \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\]

For the inverse problem (calculating angles from a matrix of numbers), we can do
\[
\begin{aligned}
	\varphi &= \mathrm{atan}2 (r_{2,3}, r_{1, 3}) \\
	\vartheta &= \mathrm{atan}2 \left(\sqrt{r_{1,3}^2 + r_{2,3}^2}, r_{3, 3}\right) \quad \vartheta \in (0, \pi)\ \text{since we took + sign} \\
	\psi &= \mathrm{atan}2 \left(r_{3,2}, -r_{3,1}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
- if we divide by zero somewhere we get degenerate solutions where we can only get the sum of the angles (one of the problems with Euler angles)
- alternative is **RPY angles**, which are also three rotations (roll, pitch, yaw) and are just as bad

##### Denavit & Hartenberg Notation
For relating the base and the end effector, we need to both **rotate** and **translate**, so we'll use **homogeneus coordinates** (matrix is \(4 \times 4\), encoding both rotation and translation):

\[
{\scriptstyle \text{A} \atop \scriptstyle\text{EE}} A = \begin{bmatrix} {\scriptstyle \text{A} \atop \scriptstyle\text{EE}} R & {\scriptstyle \text{A} \atop \scriptstyle\text{EE}} P \\ 000 & 1\end{bmatrix}
\]

To create the homogeneous coordinates in a standardized way, we use the Denavit & Hartenberg (DH) notation which systematically relates the frames of two consecutive links. We have **4 parameters**, each of which relates frame \(i\) to frame \(i - 1\):

| parameter                    | meaning                                                  |
| --:                          | ---                                                      |
| **link length \(a_i\)**      | distance between \(z_i\) and \(z_{i - 1}\) along \(x_i\) |
| **link offset \(d_i\)**      | distance between \(x_i\) and \(x_{i - 1}\) along \(z_i\) |
| **link twist \(\alpha_i\)**  | angle between \(z_i\) and \(z_{i - 1}\) around \(x_i\)   |
| **joint angle \(\theta_i\)** | angle between \(x_i\) and \(x_{i - 1}\) around \(z_i\)   |

Example: anthropomorphic arm (3 revolute joins):

|     | \(a_i\) | \(d_i\)     | \(\alpha_i\)  | \(\theta_i\)   |
| --- | ---     | ---         | ---           | ---            |
| 1   | \(0\)   | \(\pi / 2\) | \(0\)         | \(\theta_1^*\) |
| 2   | \(a_2\) | \(0\)       | \(0\)         | \(\theta_2^*\) |
| 3   | \(a_3\) | \(0\)       | \(0\)         | \(\theta_3^*\) |

We then get the following transformations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
	A^0_1 (\theta_1) &= \begin{bmatrix} c_1 & 0 & s_1 & 0 \\ s_1 & 0 & -c_1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad R = R_z(\theta_1) \cdot R_x(\pi / 2) \\
	A^{i-1}_i (\theta_1) &= \begin{bmatrix} c_i & -s_i & 0 & a_i c_i \\ s_i & c_i & 0 & a_i s_i \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad i = 2, 3\\
\end{aligned}
\]

To get the final transformations, we can multiply the matrices and get \(T^0_3 (\mathbf{q}) = A^0_1 A^1_2 A^2_3\)

#### Inverse Kinematics
{% math ENdefinition "inverse kinematics" %}the process of finding a set of joint parameters \((q_1, \ldots, q_n)\) given the position/orientation of the **end-effector** \((r_1, \ldots, r_m)\).{% endmath %}

\[(q_1, \ldots, q_n) = G(r_1, \ldots, r_m)\]

{% math ENdefinition "primary workspace" %}set \(\mathrm{WS}_1\) of all positions \(p\) that can be reached with _at least one_ orientation \(R\){% endmath %}

{% math ENdefinition "secondary workspace" %}set \(\mathrm{WS}_2\) of all positions \(p\) that can be reached with _any_ orientation \(R\){% endmath %}

##### Analytical solution (closed form)
- preferred (if it can be found)
- use geometric inspection, solve system of equations

Example: spherical wrist (3 revolute joins):

\[T_6^3(\mathbf{q}) = \begin{bmatrix} c_4 c_5 c_6 - s_4 s_6 & -c_4 c_5 s_6 - s_4 c_6 & c_4 s_5 & c_4 s_5 d_6 \\ s_4 c_5 c_6 + c_4 s_6 & -s_4 c_5 s_6 + c_4 c_6 & s_4 s_5 & s_4 s_5 d_6 \\ -s_5 c_6 & s_5 s_6 & c_5 & c_5 d_6 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

The matrix \(R\) is a ZYZ Euler rotation matrix and can be solved as such (see [Body pose](#body-pose)).
- we use indexes \(3\) to \(6\), because the wrist is usually at an end of another manipulator

{% math ENdefinition "decoupling" %}dividing inverse kinematics problem for two simpler problems, **inverse position kinematics** and **inverse orientation kinematics**{% endmath %}
- is applicable for manipulators with _at least 6 joints_ where the _last 3 intersect at a point_

The general approach is the following:
1. calculate the orientations and position where the wrist needs to be
2. calculate the orientations of the rest of the robot

##### Numerical solution (iterative form)

TBA
- Gradient method derivation (might be on the exam)

```
# will be typeset shortly
H(q) = 1/2 ||r_d f_r(q)||^2
dH / dq = 1/2  2 (-1) [r_d - f_r(q)]^T J_r(q)
dH / dq = (-1) [r_d - f_r(q)]^T J_r(q)  // nabla transposes
nabla q H(q) = (-1) [r_d - f_r(q)] J_r(q)^T  // nabla transposes
