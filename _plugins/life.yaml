    - "**Played Laser Tag** 🔫<br>
      Had a really fun laser tag session with a bunch of my friends!
      Tried to record the matches -- the footage is quite blurry but still very fun: [1](https://tom.ggu.cz/big/2022-12-29-1.mp4), [2](https://tom.ggu.cz/big/2022-12-29-2.mp4), [3](https://tom.ggu.cz/big/2022-12-29-3.mp4), [4](https://tom.ggu.cz/big/2022-12-29-4.mp4)."

      Went with Kačka and a few of my friends and wow, what a great movie!

    - "**Advent of Code completed!** 🎄<br>
      I successfully completed this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)!
      Although there were some problems that took a few hours (I'm looking at you, day 19), I managed to solve all of them quite reasonably and arguably better than last year."
