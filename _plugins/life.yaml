        Went with Kačka and a few of my friends and wow, what a great movie!

      I successfully completed this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)!
      Although there were some problems that took a few hours (I'm looking at you, day 19), I managed to solve all of them quite reasonably and arguably better than last year."
