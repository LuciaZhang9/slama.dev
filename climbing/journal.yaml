  note: The new set is great! Most of the yellows were quite easy, only two remain
    (one of which I'm confident will go). I will give them some attempts on Friday
    and we'll see how it goes.

  note: Today was again great! I unexpectedly climbed two new yellows -- one in the
    45 and one from the previous setting. I'm not sure whether I'll be able to climb
    any more new routes until next setting, since the remaining ones are truly difficult.

  note: I had no idea that I would be able to do both of the remaining yellows from
    the previous setting yet here were are! I found easier beta for both, so they
    were quite doable. Really looking forward to the new boulders!
